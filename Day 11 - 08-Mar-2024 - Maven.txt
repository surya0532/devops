What is an artifact?
What is maven number?
What is groupid   ( is noting but project structure )


Steps to create a maven project

Command to create maven project
> mvn  archetype:generate



Choose a number or apply filter:  

Note: Type of the project is dependent on the above number
1740  --  For Spring project
2110  --  For sample maven project
1244 --  MVC 4 Web application
2630 --  Project for multiple platforms web, Android and iOS



Lets select the default number: 1917  -ENter default number - It will take time


Now, we need to choose the version
Lets take the default one 8



Now, Define value for group id


What is groupid
Is used to  follow a project structure

ex:
For commercial application -- Ex:  com.<project_name>
For government application -- Ex:  gov.<project_name>
For organization application -- Ex:  org.<project_name>




Define the value for groupID: com.icicibank


What is  Artifactid: webappicicibank      ( With this name artifcat will be created )

We get  BUILD SUCCESS message




In which location project is created?
In that location, we find src folder and pom.xml file




src contains two folders.
main and test





Code created by the developer will be in main folder.

Code created by the developer for unit testing will be in test folder.




POM  --  stands for Project  Object model. 
It is an xml file, which will store all the external API information.





++++++++++++++++++++++++


Open gitbash
change directory to webappicicibank
$ git init
$ git status
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "first commit"

+++++++++++++++++++++
https://search.maven.org/   --  maven global  server

Developer will search for the required API  here 
Ex: 
1) search for mysql  ( select the required API )  - select version
copy the dependency tag and paste in pom.xml

2) search for google  map
copy the dependency tag and paste in pom.xml


Now, we need to download the API from Maven Global server to Maven local repository.
 Open command prompt  
 >  cd  webappicicibank
 > mvn compile

Maven local repository is created with the name  .m2

+++++++++++
Open git bash
Go to working directory
$ git status
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "second commit"

++++++++++++++
Notes:  Adding 3rd party API to pom.xml file.

Observe the folder structure created in the maven project ( webappicici )
We can find the folder structure as mentioned in "groupid"

They have given sample java Project.
Copy code in App.java, lets create a new  java file, save as Sample.java  ( change class name also) 


code
---------
package com.durga;

/**
 * Hello world!
 *
 */
public class Sample
{
    public static void main( String[] args )
    {
        System.out.println( "Hello " );
    }
}

+++++++++++++++++++

Now, we need to compile the java files  
In command prompt
> mvn compile

Observation:
A new folder target is created in webappdurga, we can see the class files.

+++++++++++++++++
Similarly
goto src/test/java/com/durga
create  another java file with the name SampleTest.java

Add one line of code at the end  ( for our reference )
System.out.println("Testing Passed");

+++++++++++++++
Now, we need to convert the unit testing code into .class file, for that we have command 

> mvn test

++++++++++++++++
Observation:
In folder target , test-classes will be created , which contains .class files

+++++++++++++++++
To create Artifact

> mvn  package

Where is the location of the artifact?
