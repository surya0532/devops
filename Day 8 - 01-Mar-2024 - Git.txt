Git  rebase
==============
This is called as fastforward merge.
The commits from the child branch are added to the top of the master branch.
This is helpful when we want code from a branch to be reflected as the latest working version on master.


Rearrange the commit order
---------------------------
git rebase  -i   HEAD~4


Merge the commit's using "squash"
--------------------------------
git rebase -i HEAD~4
Remove the pick word and replace it with squash

------------------

How to selectively pickup the commit's from child branch ( Cherry-pick )
